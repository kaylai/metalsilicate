"""
metalsilicate

Python library for calculating thermodynamic parameters of geochemical systems with both silicate
melt and Fe-rich metal in equilibrium.

Originally developed by Iacovino et al. to process a partitioning database and data from completed
gas levitation laser melting experiments to develop a thermodynamic model for Si partitioning
between silicate melt and Fe-rich metal in support of assessing the cataclysmic reduction hypothesis
for Mercuryâ€™s origin
